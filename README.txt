🎓 Student Score Predictor
📌 Overview
The Student Score Predictor is a Machine Learning–based web application that predicts a student’s academic score using key factors such as Hours Studied, Sleep Hours, and Attendance Percentage.
This project demonstrates an end-to-end ML workflow including data preprocessing, model training, and deployment using Streamlit

🎯 Objectives
Analyze the impact of study habits and lifestyle on academic performance
Build a regression-based Machine Learning model
Deploy the model as an interactive web application
Provide real-time score prediction through a simple UI

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
Streamlit
Pickle
